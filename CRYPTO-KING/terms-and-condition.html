    <p>By using our services, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. Please read these terms carefully before proceeding, as they govern your use of our platform. By registering on our site and engaging in investment activities, you acknowledge and accept all terms outlined below.</p>

    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Platform/We/Us:</strong> Refers to CRYPTO KING.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. Registration</h2>
    <p>Users must provide an accurate and verifiable wallet address during registration. The provided wallet address will serve as the sole address for all incoming deposits and outgoing withdrawals. Users will not be able to change this address post-registration without prior verification procedures. You are solely responsible for ensuring that the correct wallet address is provided at the time of registration.</p>

    <h2>3. Deposits</h2>
    <p>All deposits made into your investment account must originate from the registered wallet address. Any deposits made from unregistered wallet addresses will not be processed and will be rendered as void. Deposits are processed after confirmation on the blockchain network. Processing times may vary depending on network conditions.</p>

    <h2>4. Withdrawals</h2>
    <p>Withdrawals from the platform will only be processed to the registered wallet address. It is your responsibility to maintain access to the wallet associated with the registered address. We are not liable for any losses resulting from lost access to your wallet. Once funds are transferred to the registered wallet address, CRYPTO KING holds no further liability for the security or management of those funds.</p>

    <h2>5. Investment Risks</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrency investments involve high risk. By using the platform, you acknowledge that you understand the inherent risks associated with investing in digital currencies and that you are solely responsible for any financial loss. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and CRYPTO KING does not guarantee profits or protection against losses.</p>

    <h2>6. Account Security</h2>
    <p>Users are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their account login information and the private keys associated with their registered wallet address. CRYPTO KING will never request your private keys or passwords. Any requests for such information should be considered fraudulent and reported to our support team immediately.</p>

    <h2>7. Fees</h2>
    <p>The platform may charge fees for deposits, withdrawals, and certain investment activities. These fees will be transparently displayed at the time of the transaction. Blockchain network fees may also apply and are the responsibility of the user.</p>

    <h2>8. Compliance and Legality</h2>
    <p>Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of the platform complies with local laws and regulations concerning cryptocurrency trading and investment. CRYPTO KING reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts in the event of illegal activity, fraud, or misuse of the platform.</p>

    <h2>9. Modification of Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these terms at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on the platform. Continued use of the platform after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>CRYPTO KING reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account without prior notice if we detect any suspicious or fraudulent activity, or if you violate any terms outlined herein. Upon termination, any remaining funds will be rendered as void and shall serve as compensation to the platform.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>CRYPTO KING is not liable for any losses resulting from market fluctuations, technical issues, unauthorized access to your account, or the loss of access to your registered wallet address. Under no circumstances shall CRYPTO KING be responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the platform.</p>
